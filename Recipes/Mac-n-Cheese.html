    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a completely unpretentious, down-home macaroni and cheese recipe just like my grandma and mom always made. A simple white sauce where you add cheese and a few other flavors with macaroni and a potato chip crust. This recipe makes a lot, I like to make two pans so I can take one to a pot luck and have the other one to keep in the fridge for later. It's an easy recipe to adjust down if you only want to make one pan. If you aren't cooking it right away, just keep the topping separate until you are ready to put it in the oven.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¾ pounds whole-wheat macaroni</li>
            <li>¾ cup butter</li>
            <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>6 cups milk, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step One:</strong>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li><strong>Step Two</strong>Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Slowly add flour to butter, whisking constantly; cook until brown and the mixture no longer smells of flour, about 5 minutes. Pour 1 cup milk into the flour mixture, whisking continually until fully incorporated, about 45 seconds; repeat twice. Add remaining 3 cups milk to the mixture, whisking to incorporate. Stir Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper into the mixture; season with salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Step Three</strong>Reduce heat to low. Cook sauce, whisking frequently, until it begins to thicken, about 10 minutes. Add about half the package of shredded Cheddar cheese; stir continually until the cheese melts completely. Repeat with remaining half package of Cheddar cheese and the American cheese, about 4 ounces at a time. Once cheese is entirely incorporated, remove sauce from heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Steo Four</strong>Stir drained macaroni into the cheese sauce to coat. Divide macaroni between two 9x13-inch baking dishes.</li>
        </ol>
