# odin-recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum and focuses on building a simple recipe website. It is designed to reinforce foundational HTML skills and provide hands-on experience with the following concepts:

- Structuring a webpage using HTML
- Working with headings, paragraphs, and lists
- Linking different pages within the website
- Adding and displaying images on a webpage

Once completed, I will have demonstrated my ability to create a basic multi-page website using HTML, manage files and directories, and understand the essential structure of a webpage. This project serves as the first step towards more complex web development tasks.
